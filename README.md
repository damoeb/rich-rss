# rich-RSS

`rich-RSS` is a middleware that allows you to manage feed subscriptions as a feed consumer and feed producer. This includes archive, filter and transform RSS/ATOM/OPML or JSON feeds into a verbose rich feed. Try the [live demo](https://richrss.migor.org/). `Rich` in this context is an umbrella term for the following features.

## Features

- [Network control](docs/Network-Control.md)
- [Social Feeds](docs/Social-RSS.md) extension
    - Comments
    - Timeline
- Enrichment of content
  - Full(-text) feed items
  - Quality/Quantity stats
  - media data for embedded videos/audios and images.
  - media conversion
  - Speech-to-text and ocr
- Fulltext search
- Aggregation of multiple feeds
- [Throttling](docs/Throttling.md) of sources  
- [Routing](docs/Routing.md)
- [Filtering](docs/Filtering.md)
- Information Overload Protection
- [Web-to-Feed](docs/Web-to-Feed.md) support using [rss-bridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge) / [rss-proxy](https://github.com/damoeb/rss-proxy)
- Wayback support to rebuild old feeds
- [Privacy](docs/Privacy.md)

 `rich-RSS` can be configured to use the feed generators [rss-proxy](https://github.com/damoeb/rss-proxy) and [rss-bridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge), e.g as a fallback for a broken feed.
Some features are very resource intense and require a paid subscription.

## Using docker-compose (Recommended)
